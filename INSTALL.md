# Installation

For the install three files are needed.
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and the [Tool](https://github.com/sukram230799/central-device-lifecycle-tool/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) itself.

## Git

You shouldn't see any errors in the console. If you do, the installation didn't work. Please check if you have Network connectivity.

Once the installation is complete, you can close the window.
